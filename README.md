## FAQ

**Is this safe?**
Yes. The script uses Epic's official OAuth flow. Your password is never entered in the script, you login directly on Epic's website. The script only receives a temporary token that can read your locker, nothing else.

**Why do I need to login again after a while?**
The token expires after ~2 hours for security reasons. This is normal.

**Some items are missing?**
The script can only show items that exist in fortnite.gg's database. Very new items might not be added yet.
